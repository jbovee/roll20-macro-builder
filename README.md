# Roll20 Macro Builder
An interactive form for building Roll20 macros that use the 5e character sheet templates

[jbovee.github.io/roll20-macro-builder](https://jbovee.github.io/roll20-macro-builder)

## About
roll20-macro-builder uses [reactjs](https://reactjs.org) to generate macros for use on [Roll20](https://roll20.net).
Users can pick from any of the OGL (5e character sheet) templates, fill out the fields for that template, and immediately see how their macro will look when used.

## Future
- Adding buttons to template
	- Button to add at cursor
	- New form specifically for buttons
	- Modify preview to show button style
	- Total output of all macro components
		- Converting certain characters to unicode depending on how many layers in they are
